# **Deep Transfer learning Based Radio Map Estimation**
This work demonstrates the application of transfer learning in wireless communications. It illustrates how the use of transfer learning can save a huge amount of training data (sensor measurement) which is requied when the wireless environmnets change. In particular, the proposed transfer learning method estimates radio map for indoor wireless environmnets that can have many applications, including channel modelling, resource allocation, network planning, and reducing the number of necessary power measurements. The same method can also be effectivly used for outdoor wireless environments. To this line, we design an effective novel data-driven transfer learning procedure that transfers and fine-tunes a deep neural network (DNN)-based model for a radio map learned from an original indoor wireless environment to other different indoor wireless environments. Our method allows to predict the amount of training data needed in new indoor wireless environments when performing the operation of transfer learning using our data-driven similarity measure. As a result, our proposed transfer learning method achieves a saving of 60-70 % in sensor measurement data and is able to adapt to a new wireless environment with a small amount of additional data.
